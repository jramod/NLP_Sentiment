# NLP_Sentiment
Sentiment Classification is a core NLP task that involves categorizing the emotional tone of a piece of text such as a movie review into classes like positive/ negative. In this project, I will implement and evaluate multiple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for sentiment classification, treating it as a sequence classification problem.
